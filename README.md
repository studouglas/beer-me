# What is BeerMe?
Integrates with LCBO API to recommend locally-available beers that you've never tried before. Every time BeerMe recommends a beer, it saves it so you'll never have to try the same beer again. BeerMe makes sure that the beer is in stock, and even shows you how many are left at your local store so you know if you have to hurry.

If you're feeling a little wild, you can choose to only see beers with at least 6.5% alcohol -- please use responsibly.

# Try it Out!
You can try it out for yourself at [http://stuartdouglas.ca/beer/beer.html](http://stuartdouglas.ca/beer/beer.html).

# Note About Caches
BeerMe saves all the beers it's recommended before in your local **browser cache**. This means that if you switch browsers, use incognito mode, or clear your cache it will forget all the beers you've tried.
